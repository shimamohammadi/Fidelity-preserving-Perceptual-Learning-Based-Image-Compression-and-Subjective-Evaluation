# Fidelity-preserving Perceptual Learning-Based Image Compression and Subjective Evaluation

This dataset contains the folowwing information:

   A directory containing crop images:
        <br /> A subdirectory containing LBIC-PO
        <br /> A subdirectory containing LBIC-CO  
        <br /> A subdirectory containing Ref  
        
   A directory containing full images:
        <br /> A subdirectory containing LBIC-PO
        <br /> A subdirectory containing LBIC-CO  
        <br /> A subdirectory containing Ref    

    The "LBIC-CO" refers to the learning-based codec without any perceptual optimization techniques applied.
    The "LBIC-PO" refers to the learning-based codec with perceptual optimization techniques applied.

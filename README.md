# Fidelity-preserving Learning-Based Image Compression: Loss Function and Subjective Evaluation Methodology

This repository contains the results of the subjective tests conducted in the experiment.

Cropped images used in the subjective test

- LBIC-PO: The "LBIC-PO" refers to the learning-based codec with perceptual optimization techniques applied.
- LBIC-CO: The "LBIC-CO" refers to the learning-based codec without any perceptual optimization techniques applied.
- Reference: The uncompressed reference images

The subjective results is available in the preference.csv file.

# Perceptual-Optimization-in-Learning-Based-Image-Compression

The dataset folder in the repository has three sub-folders named LBIC-CO, LBIC-PO, and reference. These sub-folders contain different sets of data related to the evaluation.

The "LBIC-CO" sub-folder contains data related to the learning-based codec without any perceptual optimization techniques applied.

The "LBIC-PO" sub-folder contains data related to the learning-based codec with perceptual optimization techniques applied.

The "reference" sub-folder include reference data or the uncompressed images.

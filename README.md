# Fidelity-preserving Learning-Based Image Compression: Loss Function and Subjective Evaluation Methodology

### This dataset contains the folowwing information:

## Crop images:

        Cropped images used in the subjective test
          LBIC-PO: The "LBIC-PO" refers to the learning-based codec with perceptual optimization techniques applied.
          LBIC-CO: The "LBIC-CO" refers to the learning-based codec without any perceptual optimization techniques applied.
          Reference: The uncompressed reference images

The subjective results is available in the preference.csv file.
